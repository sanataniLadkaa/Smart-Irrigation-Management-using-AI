## Introduction

Efficient water management is crucial for agriculture, especially in regions facing water scarcity. This project aims to develop an intelligent irrigation system using machine learning algorithms to optimize water usage and improve crop yield.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the irrigation dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict optimal irrigation schedules.
- **Visualization**: Visualize data and model results using various plotting libraries.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of different models and choose the best one for deployment.


## Usage

1. **Importing Libraries and Loading Dataset**: The notebook begins with importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import plotly.express as px
    ```

2. **Data Analysis**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset better.

3. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models to predict irrigation requirements.

4. **Evaluation**: Assess the models' performance and visualize the results.

## Dataset
